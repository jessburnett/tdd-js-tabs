How To: Tabs

covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Version control
* Reproducible builds
* Static code analysis (linting)
* Cross-browser testing
* JavaScript modules
* Test-driven development of front-end code
* The Document Object Model
* Design and Refactoring

In the series, we use these techniques to develop a basic tab-switching effect. This repository contains the source code developed in the series.


To try the code on your computer:
---------------------------------

1. Install [Node.js 0.12.4](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.4/).
2. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Open a command prompt.
4. Change to the directory that will contain the project. In your command prompt, type: `cd <directory>` (where `<directory>` is the directory that will contain the project).
5. Copy the source repository to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/jessburnett/tdd-js-tabs.git`
6. Change to the project directory: `cd tdd-js-tabs`

To run the build on windows:
1. Run jake: `jake.cmd`

To run on Mac or Linux
1. Run jake: `jake.sh`
