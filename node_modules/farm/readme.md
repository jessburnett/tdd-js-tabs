# HTTP/HTTPS server farm made easy

Provides means to scale HTTP/HTTPS servers in unobtrusive way.
Uses haproxy as reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, and stud as HTTPS terminator.
Supports socket.io. Serves permissive Flash Sockets Policy.

## How to Install

    apt-get install runit libev-dev libssl-dev
    npm install farm

Go to ~/node_modules/farm and run

Now you have haproxy listening to :80 for HTTP and :443 for HTTPS.

## How to use

Edit /etc/service/haproxy/haproxy.conf and /etc/service/stud/run. Changes you might want to make are marked with 'CONFIG:'.

_N.B. Your server should respond to health requests emitted by haproxy to ensure the farm node is alive and functional._
You can simply prepend your middleware with bundled connect-compatible handler found at node/health.js:

    app.use(require('lib/health')());

## Example

    cd node
    node example.js
    open http://localhost
    open https://localhost
